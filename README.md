# BellmansGAPJLU
Bellman's GAP at JLU Gie√üen

Apparently github-pages doesn't support PHP (it doesn't support non-static sites and therefore no server-side languages of any sorts). 

That is why the index.php doesn't get executed when you load the site: https://leomeror.github.io/BellmansGAPJLU or https://leomeror.github.io/BellmansGAPJLU/index.php

The gapc functionality might be implemented in javascript, but (I think) that defeats the purpose of storing .gap-files on the server. 

This Repository was made public solely to host it on github-pages for testing purposes.
Maybe it would be smarter to change it back to private.
